# Reporting Issues
If you think the app is missing an important feature, or one of the implemented features contains a bug, you can create an issue in the GitHub's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/rendeer-pl/VideoTrimmer/issues).

## Information to Include in the Issue Description
Whenever creating a new Issue, GitHub will recommend using one of predefined templates. Please select the most appropriate template and be as descriptive as necessary. It might also be helpful to attach files like screenshots or problematic videos. Thank you for your time!
