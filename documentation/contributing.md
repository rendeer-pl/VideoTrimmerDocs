# Contributing

Video Trimmer is developed, for free, by people who find it useful and want to contribute their time to the project. While functional, it is still in a pretty rough shape, and there still a lot to be done to make it a fully valuable piece of software. If you think you can help, feel free to clone the Video Trimmer's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rendeer-pl/VideoTrimmer), implement your changes and submit a pull request. 

Please keep in mind the following:

1. If you need an inspiration on what area needs improvement, take a look at the project's [Issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/rendeer-pl/VideoTrimmer/issues).
1. The core pillar of Video Trimmer's design is simplicity, and any feature suggestions will be evaluated based on the ratio between the increased usability and complexity that the feature introduces to the app. We want the Video Trimmer to remain very easy to use, and possibly even improve in that regard.
1. When submitting a pull request, please ensure that it contains only one feature or fixes a single issue. It will make the review much easier, and will reduce the chances of some small issues preventing the whole merge.
1. Since the Video Trimmer has been released under the very permissive [MIT license](https://soft.rendeer.pl/VideoTrimmer/license/), any contributions to the Video Trimmer are automatically considered to be bound by the same MIT license. This is a result of the section [Contributions Under Repository License of the GitHub's Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license).
