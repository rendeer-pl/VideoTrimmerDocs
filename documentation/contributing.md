# Contributing

Video Trimmer is developed, for free, by people who find it useful and want to contribute their time to the project. While functional, it is still in a pretty rough shape, and there still a lot to be done to make it a fully valuable piece of software. If you think you can help, feel free to clone the Video Trimmer's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rendeer-pl/VideoTrimmer), implement your changes and submit a pull request. If you need an inspiration on what area needs improvement, take a look at the project's [Issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/rendeer-pl/VideoTrimmer/issues).

## Contributing Without Coding
If you are not interested in coding, you can still help by submitting a bug report. See [reporting issues](https://soft.rendeer.pl/VideoTrimmer/reporting_issues) for more info on how to do that.
